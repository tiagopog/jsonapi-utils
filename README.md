# JSONAPI::Utils

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/jsonapi-utils`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

Required doc:

* Describe something about the awesome `jsonapi-resources` gem
* Describe how it's easy to serialize JSON API-based responses using the `jsonapi-utils` gem
* JSONAPI::Utils#jsonapi_render (show options like `json`, `resource`, `model`, `scope` and `count`)
* JSONAPI::Utils#jsonapi_serialize
* Example of a model
* Example of a resource
* Example of a base controller and another whatever controller

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jsonapi-utils'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jsonapi-utils

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
